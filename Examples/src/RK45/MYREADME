Comments to 3rd set of challenges

The basic versions (e.g. RK45 and RK23) work fine, while the other versions (challenges 3.2,3.3) sometimes have a bug but I cannot find it (for almost trivial functions the code seems correct). 

I didn't have time to modify the files for non-linear systems and make them generic (i.e. using templates) as the RK classes. 

Execution
In file main_rk45.cpp you have to uncomment the parts of the code you want to compile/run.
To compile, just follow the instructions given by typing make.
