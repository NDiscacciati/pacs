Comments to Challenge 2

You may find my answer to the challenges in these folders:
./chal for challenges 2.1 and 2.3
./chal2 for challenges 2.2 and 2.3

In both cases, use the Makefile in order to compile the programs. To run them, just type ./main_poly

The files for Challenge 2.3 are: BoundaryEdges.dat, AllEdges.dat and InternalEdges.dat respectively.
