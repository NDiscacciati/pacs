In all the challenges I comment the part of the code that uses Gnuplot. It should run correctly leaving this part.
I write here some comments to the program.
To execute different challenges you need to change a parameter in the input file (default: parameters.pot), in this way: 1=challenge 1.2 (different norms), 2=challenge 1.3 (Thomas), 3=challenge 1.3add (transient)

Challenge 1.2
Both the norms are computed via a quadrature formula. In particular, L2 norm uses Simpson (I avoided to add the value in the mean point using the explicit expression of the straight line), while for the H1 seminorm I used the rectangulus formula, since it's (locally) constant.

Challenge 1.3 additional
I modified the matrix adding one line at the beginning in order to avoid problems with Dirichlet condition. I modified also the last line in order to sathisfy Neumann's one.
I assumed the initial condition as a constant, just to simplify the program, even though non-constant conditions can be (almost) easily implemented.
For the same reason, I saved only the solution at the final step.
